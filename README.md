I completed the project in about an hour

Follow this video walkthrough (Swift version). In the recent version of Xcode, there is no empty project template just choose a Single View Application which will generate a Storyboard and a ViewController, you can ignore both files. Just set the rootViewController in the app delegate as shown in the video, and it will ignore the Storyboard. COMPLETE
Augment the tip calculator app with a settings view. Review these hints (Swift version) to complete this task. COMPLETE
OPTIONAL: The Tip calculator has a very primitive UI. Feel free to play with colors, layout, or even modify the UI to improve it DID NOT
